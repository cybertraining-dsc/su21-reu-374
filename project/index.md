**Keywords:** AI, ML, DL, Cybersecurity, Cyber Attacks, IoT. 


## 1. Introduction


 My first research on AI Time analysis includes query on stock market data stucture.
 The mean (level), maximum, minimum values; Time Series Data Components - trend, seasonality, noise or randomness, a curve, and the level.
 Blockchain levies to be the coin flip of how Artificial Intellignece predicts future prices through machine learning.
 What codes exist that demonstrate the use of blockchain with AI using Python?
 What is the code in this project that will be developed?
 What is the performance of this code?
 What is my conclusion?
 Never, ever use the words ‘I’ or ‘my’ in a report

## 2. Datasets

This report pertains a .CSV file of a dataset predicting the consumption of electricity in the coming future.                                                         [archive.zip](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/su21-reu-374/files/6743411/archive.zip)




## 3. Using Images


- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following link, replace the fa number with my su number and thne chart of png.
- [ ] If  the image has been copied, you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption.
 
![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].


## 4. Benchmark


Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]


## 5. Conclusion


A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.
