## Abstract

Here comes a short abstract of the project that summarizes what it is about

Contents

{{% /pageinfo %}}

**Keywords:** AI, ML, DL, Cybersecurity, Cyber Attacks, IoT. 


## 1. Introduction


- [ ] Find literature about AI and Cyber Attacks on IoT Devices Dectection.
- [ ] Analyze the literature and explain how AI for Cyber Attacks on IOT Devices Detection are beneficial.


## 2. Datasets

- [ ] Finding data sets in IoT Devices Cyber Attacks.
- [ ] Can any of the data sets be used in AI?
- [ ] What are the challenges with IoT Devices Cyber Attacks data set? Privacy, HIPPA, Size, Avalibility
- [ ] Datasets can be huge and GitHub has limited space. Only very small datasets should be stored in GitHub.
      However, if the data is publicly available you program must contain a download function instead that you customize.
      Write it using pythons `request`. You will get point deductions if you check-in data sets that are large and do not use
      the download function.


## 3. Using Images


- [ ] Place a cool image into projects images in my directory
- [ ] Correct the following link, replace the fa number with my su number and thne chart of png.
- [ ] If  the image has been copied, you must use a reference such as shown in the Figure 1 caption.
 
![Figure 1](https://github.com/cybertraining-dsc/fa20-523-314/raw/main/project/images/chart.png)

**Figure 1:** Images can be included in the report, but if they are copied you must cite them [^1].


## 4. Benchmark


Your project must include a benchmark. The easiest is to use cloudmesh-common [^2]


## 5. Conclusion


A convincing but not fake conclusion should summarize what the conclusion of the project is.
